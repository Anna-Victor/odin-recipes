    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For this recipe, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of long grain or medium grain rice</li>
        <li>1 small carrot - 1/4 to 1/2 cup fine chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 small bell pepper (1/4 to 1/2 cup fine chopped)</li>
        <li>4 to 5 French beans (1/4 cup fine chopped)</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup fine chopped cabbage or 6 button mushrooms sliced (optimal)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup green onions (scallions, 4 stalks, separate greens & whites)</li>
        <li>1 green chilies slit (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fine chopped garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put some water in a sauce pan to boil at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice and add it to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add some oil and salt into the rice.</li>
        <li>Let the rice cook,properly and remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Cover the rice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok on the highest flame. If you don't have a wok, use a wide pan. Add garlic and saut√© just for 30 to 40 seconds, till you get an aroma. Some finedining Chinese restaurants also add star anise (whole or powder). So I do add it sometimes. This is optional but gives an awesome flavor.</li>
        <li>Set some of the green onions aside for garnish. Add all chopped vegetables and slit green chilli. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook them as we want them crunchy. But also ensure the raw flavor has gone from French beans. If you stir fry too long, scallions will lose their crunch.</li>
        <li>Optional - Next add half teaspoon sugar if you like. Using sugar keeps the color of the veggies intact & also helps to balance the flavors.</li>
        <li>Ensure the flame is still high at this stase. Add 1 tablespoon soya sauce and 1 teaspoon vinegar (optional). You can add more or less to suit your taste. Any other hot sauces you prefer can also be added at this stage. Do not cook the veggies further at this stage as they will sweat out and become mushy.</li>
        <li>The sauce will bubble immediately & begin to smoke. Then add cooled rice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
        <li>Toss, mix, stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Taste test. If needed add more sauce & salt now to suit your taste. Remember the entire cooking process should happen on the highest flame. Otherwise the moisture from the veggies can make the rice mushy. Garnish veg fried rice with spring onion greens. This fried rice can be served with any of these sides:
            <ul>
                <li>Veg manchurian</li>
                <li>Chilli paneer</li>
                <li>Chilli chicken</li>
                <li>Gobi manchurian</li>
                <li>Chilli potato</li>
                <li>Chicken manchurian</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
